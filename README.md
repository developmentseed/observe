## History

Observe is a project that was conceptualized a few years ago in collaboration with [Digital Democracy](https://www.digital-democracy.org/) and [GFDRR](https://www.gfdrr.org/en). Back then react-native wasn't in a good place for building something production ready. A lot of what you see in Observe currently, would not have been possible without their support.
